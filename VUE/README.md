# How to bind MongoDB to a Pivot Table

A quick start project for connecting a MongoDB to a Syncfusion Pivot Table. This repository includes a Web API Controller ([MyWebService](../MyWebService/)) for retrieving data from a MongoDB, as well as a quick start sample in the Vue platform that displays the retrieved data in a Syncfusion Pivot Table.
